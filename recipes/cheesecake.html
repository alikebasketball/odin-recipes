        <h2>Cheesecake Description</h2>
        <p>
            Although not specific to this recipe, <b>Cheesecake</b> is one of the best items in the <em>entire world </em> to
            eat! I have trouble staying true to my cut in my workout cycle because it is so tempting! I mean if my
            lovely girlfriend even mentions it to me, I have this hunger that I can not hold in any longer. I must eat
            the Cheesecake!

                <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.</li>
            <li>To make the crust: Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.</li>
            <li>To make the filling: Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
